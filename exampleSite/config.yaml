      - title: Modified Ribosome Simulation
        content: Developed a Python program simulating a modified ribosome's functionality for building amino acid chains from RNA sequences. Implemented five special commands, including START, STOP, DEL, EXCHANGE, and SWAP, to manipulate the protein building process. Created functions to read codon mappings and evaluation orders from files, encode RNA sequences, decode amino acid chains, and operate on RNA sequences based on evaluation rules. Utilized data structures to store codon mappings and evaluation orders, ensuring efficient processing. Tested the program against various sequences and evaluation orders to verify its accuracy and functionality
