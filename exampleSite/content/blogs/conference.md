# Highlights from OpenAI's First Developer Conference

OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence research lab, recently hosted its first developer conference, DevDay 2023¹⁴. The event was packed with exciting announcements and introductions of new technologies. Here are some of the key highlights:

## GPT-4 Turbo

> OpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo, an improved version of the popular GPT-4 model³⁴. GPT-4 Turbo supports a context window of 128,000 tokens or roughly 100,000 words, which is four times more than GPT-4's context window⁴. The new model has a knowledge cut-off of April 2023, compared to GPT-4's September 2021 cutoff⁴. The text-only model is priced at $0.01/1,000 input tokens and $0.03/1,000 output tokens⁴.

## Custom GPTs

> OpenAI announced that it will let users create their own versions of GPT for fun or productivity use cases⁴. Users will be able to build these bots just through prompt without needing to know any coding⁴. The company will also let enterprise customers make internal-only GPTs built on top of the company's knowledge base⁴.

## OpenAI GPT Store

> OpenAI plans to let users publish these GPTs to a store — coming later this month — as well⁴. It will initially have creations from "verified builders"⁴. The company's CEO Sam Altman also talked about paying people with popular GPTs⁴.

## New APIs

> At its first developer day event, OpenAI launched a new Assistants API, to let developers build their own "agent-like experiences"⁴. Developers can make agents that retrieve outside knowledge or call programming functions for a specific action⁴. The use cases range includes an assistant for coding to an AI-powered vacation planner⁴.

> OpenAI’s text-to-image model DALL-E 3 is now available through API with in-built moderation tools⁴. The output regulations range from 1024×1024 to 1792×1024 in different formats⁴. Open AI has priced the model at $0.04 per generated image⁴.

> The company also launched a new text-to-speech API called Audio API with six preset voices: Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova and Shimer⁴.

> These announcements mark significant advancements in AI technology and demonstrate OpenAI's commitment to making AI more accessible and useful. It will be exciting to see how these new tools and technologies are adopted and what impact they will have on the field of AI.
